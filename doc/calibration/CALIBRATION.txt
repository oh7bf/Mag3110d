The magnetometer offset due to "hard iron" can be determined experimentally.
First fix the MAG3110 on a wood plate on wooden table far away from any 
metals and electric currents. Set the MAGINT to 20 s in the configuration
file and monitor the log file

tail -f /var/log/mag3110d.log 

Rotate the plate around it's vertical axis, for example with 10 degree steps,
and copy the values from the log file to a new file. See for example the
file 'calib.txt'.

Plot first the Bx

plot "calib.txt" using 1:2 title 'Bx'

Define a fitting function with good initial guess values for the fitting
parameters

f(x)=a*sin(b*x+c)+d

a=200;b=0.018;c=0.2;d=-600

and finally fit the data

fit f(x) "calib.txt" using 1:2 via a, b, c, d

The parameter 'd' is the offset due to "hard iron". Multiply this with two
and write it to the configuration file to OFF_X.

Fit with data above gave following parameters

   Bx          By          Bz
a  217.428     214.096     27.3025
b  0.0173648   0.0176216   0.0174427
c  0.562796    2.08765     2.31957
d  -574.295    813.472     426.957

Using the offset values the same calibration procedure can be repeated. A new
fit can then be done. This gave the values

   Bx          By          Bz
a  215.355     216.022     29.3898 
b  0.0172921   0.0175579   0.0182363
c  0.523967    2.05018     2.14593
d  1e-30       1e-30       1e-30

The phase difference between Bx and By is 1.526213 and this is close to the
pi/2=1.570796327. Thus there is about 3 % error in orthogonality between Bx
and By. 

In above the Bz has been forced to zero. If the vertical field component 
needs to be known, the magnetometer needs to be turned first by 90 degrees
on the wooden plate before the step by step rotation. In this orientation
the fit result for Bz was

    Bz
a   216.673
b   0.0175217
c   0.452891
d   849.077

Now 2*d can be used as offset for OFF_Z.
