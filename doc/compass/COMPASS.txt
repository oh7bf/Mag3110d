After the "hard iron" offset calibration the magnetometer can be used as a
compass. The magnetometer is fixed on wooden table pointing to magnetic North.
The data is extracted from the log file with the script 'getfield.pl' and
plotted to a histogram with gnuplot script 'histfield.p'. The median for
Bx, By and Bz can be calculated with Octave for example:

data=dlmread('northcalib.txt','',1,2)

plot(data(:,1))

median(data(:,1))

This gave the median values for North direction

Bx[0.1uT]   By[0.1uT]     Bz[0.1uT]      B[0.1uT]
17+-5       -239+-4       -444+-7        504+-5

The total geomagnetic field B should be between 25 - 65 uT
